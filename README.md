# Introduction
LED MAtrix is a electronic compnent that used to display messages, adds and emojis.
It's very attractive compared to static banners. This project use 8*8 LED matrix to display simple messages and shapes.
This repo makes it so easy to anyone wants to understand not only the mechanism of LED matrix display but also its interface with one of the most popular microcontroller
STM32F10x medium denisty.
# Overview
This project is nearly complete. What you will do in this project:

* creating new messages and emojis.
* creating new mechanisms of messages motion.
* learning more about LED Matrix and STM32.

The Future updates will offer new mechanisms of display like the LEDS in the Stadiums and advanced LED-Matrix screens.
